# This will start a code-server container and expose it at http://127.0.0.1:8081 and http://127.0.0.1:8082.
# It will also mount your current directory into the container as `/home/coder/project`
# and forward your UID/GID so that all file system operations occur as your user outside
# the container.
#
# Your $HOME/.config is mounted at $HOME/.config within the container to ensure you can
# easily access/modify your code-server config in $HOME/.config/code-server/config.json
# outside the container.

# Create links for nginx to create the reverse proxy
